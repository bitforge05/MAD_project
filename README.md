Problem Statement

Many students and developers have innovative ideas but lack a centralized platform to share, collaborate, and receive feedback. Existing tools either focus on formal project management or casual social interaction, leaving a gap for an environment that encourages idea submission, discovery, and team formation. Users often struggle to find collaborators, gather constructive feedback, and track project progress in one place.

⸻

Proposed Solution / Idea

“CollaborateHub” is a web-based platform (React frontend with optional backend support using Node.js/Python) designed to facilitate idea sharing and collaborative project development. Users can submit project ideas via a structured form, search for other projects, comment, upvote, provide feedback, and request to join projects. Project owners can manage their projects, update statuses, and notify contributors of updates. The platform fosters community-driven innovation while maintaining organized, interactive, and secure collaboration.
